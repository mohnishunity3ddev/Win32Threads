    // wait() before the child has called sem post(); weâ€™d like the parent to
    // wait for the child to run. The only way this will happen is if the value
    // of the semaphore is not greater than 0; hence, 0 is the initial value.
    // The parent runs, decrements the semaphore (to -1), then waits (sleeping).
    // When the child finally runs, it will call sem post(), increment the value
    // of the semaphore to 0, and wake the parent, which will then return from
    // sem wait() and finish the program.
    // The second case occurs when the child runs to completion before the
    // parent gets a chance to call sem wait(). In this case, the child will
    // first call sem post(), thus incrementing the value of the semaphore from
    // 0 to 1. When the parent then gets a chance to run, it will call sem
    // wait() and find the value of the semaphore to be 1; the parent will thus
    // decrement the value (to 0) and return from sem wait() without waiting,
    // also achieving the desired effect.
